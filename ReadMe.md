# Playground.Typescript

Just a place for me to play around with Typescript.

[VS Code Typescript tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-tutorial) to get started.

## Building and running

- From the repo root directly, just run `tsc` to compile all of the `.ts` files into `.js`. We use the `launch.json` to build automatically before running.

- You should create your `tsconfig.json` file first before your `launch.json` file, as `launch.json` settings may be dependent on your `tsconfig.json` file settings.

- Use the `node.js` runner for running/debugging.
